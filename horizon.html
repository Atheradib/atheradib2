<b>What is an article in English? </b> <br>
A,An and The are the articles in english grammer. <br>
There are two types of articles in english grammer,the definite article and the indefinite article. <br>
In the most simple term an article is the way of letting know the listner and speaker that a noun is either unspecific or specific.

<i>let's take the example...</i> <br>
<li>During <u>The</u>  long journey,<u>The</u> family played car games.</li> <br>
You can see that when we use article 'The' that we are showing that we are talking about specific day and also specific family.'However',if we change the article,we can show that we are not talking about specific journey or family. <br>
<i>Take another example....</i> <br>
<li>During <b>a</b> long journey,<b>a</b> family can play car games.</li> <br>

simply by changing the article,we have made the sentence more general statement and not about specific thing or person. <br>
